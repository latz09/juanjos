Things to mention

Its just a first go through so not everything is perfect, like some spacing might not be perfect
I used 'lorem ipsum' (which is basically just filler text made to look real) in some areas.  So those areas can be any text or non at all.
Mobile first designed so go ahead and explore the different pages on your phone and on desktop to see the different layouts between the two
used all your own photos..except for the brownie..I couldnt find the perfect one.

This is completely from scratch, no templates of any kind, meaning anything can be changed or swapped out (like using different images, headings, colors, fonts)

Without a website to get an idea of your style, I just went with what I though you may like.  Again, anything can be changed.

Some sections are styled slightly differently, that way you guys can tell me what you like and dont like about what ive done and then I can get a better idea of what you may be looking for.  

When/if you guys are ready to discuss moving forward just let me know.
